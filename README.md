## Features

An enhanced custom component for **SwitchBot Bluetooth** devices in Home Assistant, featuring complete reverse-engineered control and entity support for the **SwitchBot Meter Pro** (`WoTHP`) and **SwitchBot Meter Pro CO2** (`WoTHPc`). Limited testing was performed on the `WoTHPc` variant. 

This integration is a direct drop-in replacement for the core Home Assistant `switchbot` integration. It seamlessly integrates with your existing devices without needing re-pairing, and works natively through **ESPHome Active Bluetooth Proxies** and local Bluetooth adapters.

  * `number.comfort_cold`: Lower temperature threshold for `COMFORT` status (°C, 0.5°C step).
  * `number.comfort_hot`: Upper temperature threshold for `COMFORT` status (°C, 0.5°C step).
* **Comfort Humidity Thresholds**:
  * `number.comfort_dry`: Lower humidity threshold before display segments show `DRY` (%).

* **Time Display Offset (`number.display_time_offset`)**: Adjust local time display offset.

### 4. Buttons (`button`)
* **Sync Date and Time (`button.sync_datetime`)**: Immediately synchronize the hardware real-time clock to Home Assistant UTC time.
* **Refresh Temperature & Humidity (`button.refresh_measurements`)**: Immediately trigger an environmental sensor (temperature and humidity) measurement refresh on the hardware (simulates top button press; does not perform CO2 sampling).
* **Force CO2 Measurement (`button.force_co2_measurement`)**: Trigger an immediate, fresh NDIR CO2 sensor measurement regardless of the sleep interval, polling the result and updating Home Assistant sensor state.
* **Silence Alarm (`button.silence_alarm`)**: Mute the active alarm buzzer sound and stop screen flashing.
* **Calibrate CO2 Sensor (`button.calibrate_co2`)**: Start the 5-minute automated CO2 sensor recalibration routine (place device in ventilated outdoor air first).

### 5. Diagnostic Sensors (`sensor` & `binary_sensor`)
* **Firmware Version (`sensor.firmware`)**: Diagnostic sensor displaying the device firmware version (e.g. `1.5`), polled and cached from device basic info.
* **USB-C Power Status (`binary_sensor.usb_c_status`)**: Diagnostic binary sensor indicating whether the Meter Pro CO2 is connected to USB-C constant power (`Connected` / `Disconnected`), updated in real time via broadcast advertisements and GATT connection.

### 6. Actions / Services (`service`)
* **`switchbot.meter_pro_set_weather`**: Push current local weather forecast condition icon to the Meter Pro LCD header.
  ```yaml
  action: switchbot.meter_pro_set_weather
  data:
    device_id: YOUR_METER_PRO_DEVICE_ID
    icon: rainy # Options: sunny, partly_cloudy, cloudy, rainy, pouring, heavy_rain, snowy, light_snow, heavy_snow, none
  ```
* **`switchbot.meter_pro_set_external_sensor_mac`**: Pair an external sensor MAC address (e.g. SwitchBot Outdoor Meter or emulated ESP32 beacon) to the Meter Pro hardware display. See the [ESPHome External Sensor Emulation](#external--outdoor-sensor-emulation-via-esphome) section below for details.
  ```yaml
  action: switchbot.meter_pro_set_external_sensor_mac
  data:
    device_id: YOUR_METER_PRO_DEVICE_ID
    mac_address: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" # Or "00:00:00:00:00:00" to clear
    slot: 1 # Optional: 1 (primary display) or 2 (secondary)
    switch_display: true # Optional (default: true): automatically switches screen to OUT on pair, or IN on clear
  ```

## External / Outdoor Sensor Emulation via ESPHome

The SwitchBot Meter Pro (and CO2) can display outdoor temperature and humidity readings received directly from an external SwitchBot Outdoor Meter via local BLE broadcasts (`0x0969` / `WoSensorTH`).

If you do not own a physical SwitchBot Outdoor Meter, **you can emulate one using any ESP32 running ESPHome** (alongside an ESPHome BLE Proxy on the same device). This allows you to broadcast any Home Assistant temperature and humidity entities as SwitchBot Outdoor Meter advertisement beacons.:

1. **Flash ESPHome**: Use the provided [ESPHome SwitchBot Beacon Template](examples/esphome_switchbot_outdoor_meter.yaml). It subscribes to any Home Assistant temperature and humidity entities and broadcasts them as SwitchBot Outdoor Meter advertisement beacons using your ESP32's BLE MAC address.
2. **Pair the MAC Address**: Call the `switchbot.meter_pro_set_external_sensor_mac` action in Home Assistant with your ESP32's Bluetooth MAC address (Slot 1). The display will automatically switch from `IN` to `OUT` as instant visual confirmation!
3. **Control Display Source**: You can toggle between internal sensor readings (`IN`) and external readings (`OUT`) programmatically via the `switch.display_data_source` entity, or physically by pressing the top hardware button (configurable via `switch.button_toggle_data_source`).

> [!NOTE]
> When `switch.button_toggle_data_source` is enabled, pressing the physical top button changes the live display in RAM. However, the hardware firmware enforces its persistent profile (`070103`) whenever button settings are written. To permanently switch the screen back to internal readings, turn off `switch.display_data_source` or clear the MAC pairing.

## Acknowledgments & Credits

* **[pySwitchbot](https://github.com/sblibs/pySwitchbot)**:
  All low-level BLE communication, packet parsing, and GATT command execution rely on `pySwitchbot`, originally authored by Daniel Hjelseth Høyer. Our Meter Pro and Meter Pro CO2 protocol implementations extend this library directly. 

  The extension is based on the following community pull requests that were not yet merged into the main `pySwitchbot` repository: 
  * [Issue #581](https://github.com/sblibs/pySwitchbot/issues/581) by [@meuxx](https://github.com/meuxx) implementing the weather icon functionality.
  
  * [Issue #559](https://github.com/sblibs/pySwitchbot/pull/559) and [Issue #430](https://github.com/sblibs/pySwitchbot/pull/430) by [@ahrmn](https://github.com/ahrmn) implementing most of the Meter Pro and Meter Pro CO2 functionality, including the calibration, the buzzer, comfort thresholds, and more.
